Welcome to the **Express.js Essentials Showcase**, a developer-friendly walkthrough of foundational to intermediate concepts in Express.js. This repo showcases practical implementations of:

- ðŸ”¸ Application-level middleware  
- ðŸ”¸ Built-in middleware  
- ðŸ”¸ Error handling  
- ðŸ”¸ Third-party integration (MongoDB, Mongoose, JSON, FileSystem)

This is your one-stop playground for learning and demoing modern Express backend features.
